			<h3 id="headline">Who Was Nikola Tesla?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric
					system, which is the predominant electrical system used across the world today. He also created the
					"Tesla coil," which is still used in radio technology.

					Born in modern-day Croatia, Tesla came to the United States in 1884 and briefly worked with Thomas
					Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several patent rights, including those to his AC
					machinery, to George Westinghouse.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Early Life</strong><br>
					Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, 1856.

					Tesla was one of five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica. Tesla's
					interest in electrical invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small
					household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up.

					Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son
					to join the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Education</strong><br>
					After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule
					Karlstadt) in Germany; the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague
					during the 1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central Telephone
					Exchange.


					It was while in Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first came to Tesla, but after
					several years of trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave Europe
					for America.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Nikola Tesla vs. Thomas Edison</strong><br>
					In 1884 Tesla arrived in the United States with little more than the clothes on his back and a
					letter of introduction to famed inventor and business mogul Thomas Edison, whose DC-based electrical
					works were fast becoming the standard in the country.

					Edison hired Tesla, and the two men were soon working tirelessly alongside each other, making
					improvements to Edison's inventions.

					Several months later, the two parted ways due to a conflicting business-scientific relationship,
					attributed by historians to their incredibly different personalities: While Edison was a power
					figure who focused on marketing and financial success, Tesla was commercially out-of-touch and
					somewhat vulnerable.
